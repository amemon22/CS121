			Hello everyone! My name is Stephanie, and I値l be your Vice President for the 2014-2015 school year. I知 a third year computer science major who made the switch from being a bio major last year. I joined student council to meet new people and learn more about what exactly ICS has to offer, and I知 really glad I did!
ICSSC has given me the chance to meet a lot of amazing people and learn so much about computer science and tech in general. It has helped me develop myself both professionally and academically, and introduced me to so many new things.
This year, I want to do the same for you! I want ICSSC to continue to be a place for awesome people to get together and do cool things, from making an app to planning amazing events, like ICS Day and Med AppJam. So stop by our meetings if you池e interested! I promise you値l have fun
