Under Construction in Surfwood
My parents have been keeping a photographic log of the construction on
their new house in Surfwood, near Mendocino
(coincidentally on a street with the same name as one we lived on
long ago in Cupertino), and asked me to take some photos for
that week's selection.
Here are my own selections
from the same shoot.  Click on any picture for a larger copy.
