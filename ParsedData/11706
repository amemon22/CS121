Undergraduate degree in Software Engineering




DEGREES AVAILABLE: Major
What is Software Engineering? 

Software Engineering combines a solid foundation in computer science with knowledge of how to engineer modern software systems, and how to function within teams.

The Software Engineering major prepares students to be productive members of software engineering teams in a variety of application domains, with focus on the domains of major importance within each decade.
   The major emphasizes the design and implementation of large software systems.

Is Software Engineering for me? 

The Software Engineering major gives students a strong foundation in software engineering as well as a solid basis in computer science. Students should consider this major if you:

Want to be a productive member of software engineering teams in a variety of application domains including, but not restricted to, Web and mobile applications
   Wish to acquire technical knowledge and have an appreciation for life-long learning
   Are excited by the ability to place software in the social context in which is it developed
   Wish to create novel applications that have the potential to bring social change

What do I take? 

See the General Catalogue for a full listing of the degree requirements. Students are encouraged to consult an academic advisor 
in the Bren School of ICS to determine the coursework designed to meet 
their educational goals.
Note: Software Engineering elective courses may not be counted as part of the Management Minor or the Biomedical Computing Minor.
Still not sure? 

Prospective and current UCI students interested in learning more about the Bren School’s degree 
options are encouraged to meet with the school’s associate dean of student affairs, counselors and
