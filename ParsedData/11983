 January 9,  2015Two ICS professors honored as ACM Fellows










Jan. 9, 2015


The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), the world’s largest educational and 

scientific computing society, has announced that two professors at UC Irvine’s Donald 

Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences — Nikil Dutt and Gene Tsudik — 

have been named 2014 ACM Fellows.


Established in 1993, the ACM Fellows Program recognizes its top members for 

outstanding accomplishments in computing and information technology. This year, only 

47 of ACM’s more than 100,000 members worldwide were named fellows. The total 

number of fellows is limited to 1 percent of ACM overall membership.


ACM President Alexander L. Wolf acknowledged the advances made by this year’s 

ACM Fellows. “Our world has been immeasurably improved by the impact of their 

innovations. We recognize their contributions to the dynamic computing technologies 

that are making a difference to the study of computer science, the community of 

computing professionals, and the universe of consumers and citizens who are benefiting 

from their creativity and commitment.”





Nikil Dutt is a Chancellor's Professor of computer science, cognitive sciences, and EECS 

at UCI. He was honored as an ACM Fellow for his contributions to embedded 

architecture exploration, and service to electronic design automation and embedded 

systems. He received a Ph.D. from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 

1989. His research interests span topics in embedded systems, electronic design 

automation, computer architecture, and brain-inspired computing. He has received 

numerous best paper awards at premier conferences and is coauthor of seven books. He 

served as Editor-in-Chief of the premier journal ACM Transactions on Design 

Automation of Electronic Systems (2003-2008) and currently serves on the ACM 

Publications Board. He is a Fellow of the IEEE, and recipient of the International 

Federation for Information Processing’s Silver Core Award.  




Gene Tsudik is a Chancellor's Professor of computer science at UCI. He earned the ACM 

fellow rank for contributions to Internet security and privacy. Gene Tsudik obtained his 

Ph.D. in Computer Science from USC in 1991. Before coming to UCI in 2000, he was at 

IBM Zurich Research Laboratory (1991-1996) and USC’s Information Sciences Institute 

(1996-2000). Over the years, his research interests have included numerous topics in 

security, privacy and applied cryptography. He has co-authored over 200 refereed 

research publications and several patents. From 2009 to 2015, he was the Editor-in-Chief 

of ACM Transactions on Information and Systems Security  — the premier archival 

journal for security and privacy research. He was awarded a Fulbright Lectureship in 

2007 (at the University of Rome) and the rank of IEEE Fellow — in 2012.


ACM will formally recognize the 2014 Fellows at its annual awards banquet in June in San Francisco.
