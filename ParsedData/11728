			Everyone is interested in tech, seeing that it is so integrated into daily life. People are usually on the lookout for the next big innovation in tech so they can incorporate it in their life. A great and entertaining source that compiles all the technological products to come is a channel on Youtube called Vsauce2.
Vasauce2 covers all the weird and wacky inventions such as tattoos that play sounds all the way to revolutionary breakthroughs like real world video game makers. It really is a fun way to delve into what people are producing and an awesome way to pass the time. The series you will most likely be interested in is called “Mind Blow.”
Next time you’re browsing through the web take a look at Vsauce2 and prepare to have your “Mind Blow[n].”
