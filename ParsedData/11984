 January 23,  2015Media Advisory: UC Irvine Holds Global Game Jam










IRVINE, Calif.—UC Irvine Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences will serve as one of the host sites for this weekend’s 2015 Global Game Jam under the leadership of Assistant Professor of Informatics and founding member of UCI’s Transformative Play Lab Joshua Tanenbaum.
 

WHAT:
UCI will serve as one of several hundred locations worldwide to bring together game-makers from around Orange County to participate in the 2015 Global Game Jam, a free “hackathon” focused on game development that challenges attendees to design, develop, create and test a new game in 48 hours.
 

WHY:
The Global Game Jam is one of the largest game-making events in the world, drawing people from over 72 countries to design more than 4,000 games in a 48-hour period. The weekend stirs a global creative buzz in games, while simultaneously allowing participants to explore the process of development—be it programming, iterative design, narrative exploration or artistic expression.
 

WHEN: 
January 23-25, 2015 BR
The event begins at 5 p.m. on Friday, January 23 and runs for 48 hours.
 

WHERE:
