Concentration in Informatics - Track in Interactive and Collaborative 
Technology (INF-ICT), (M.S. and Ph.D.)

The ICT track of the Informatics concentration focuses on studying 
and enhancing the relationship between the design and use of interactive
 systems and their applications in real-world settings.
CURRENT DEGREE REQUIREMENTS
UCI enjoys an international reputation for its research on the human 
and social dimensions of computer system design and use. There are two 
principal strands to this work. The first concerns the interaction 
between people and computers, including novel forms of interactive 
experience beyond traditional desktop computing. The second concerns the
 role that computer systems can play in collaborative work between 
individuals, groups, and organizations.
Examples of topics that ICT researchers investigate include: adoption
 and diffusion of collaborative technologies; software architectures for
 user-adaptive systems; universal access to interactive systems; design 
principles for information visualization; and new patterns of 
computer-mediated work such as virtual teams.
The approach used places equal emphasis on three areas of 
investigation--empirical, theoretical, and technical. The empirical work
 involves studying technology in use, using both laboratory techniques 
and fieldwork investigations of real-world settings. The theoretical 
research employs and develops analytic understanding of the 
relationships among technology, people, organizations, and social 
settings. Finally, in the technical work, ICT researchers develop new 
models and technologies for interaction with and collaboration through 
technology. Students in the ICT track gain a thorough grounding in all 
three areas.
The cornerstone of this approach is to study real use of technology, 
as it occurs in real-world settings. ICT researchers believe that the 
success or failure of technology depends on how people can fit that 
technology into real practice, balancing technical, cognitive, social, 
and cultural dimensions. 
Using an interdisciplinary approach, ICT research aims at a deeper 
understanding of interaction with and collaboration through technology, 
and at exploiting these insights for the design of better systems.
