Assignment 3

Give your character
an emotional response to its environment. 
This is primarily a programming assignment (i.e., connecting the
character’s emotional value to something that the character is able to
perceive), but may also include animation work or sound design if you’re
feeling inspired. 

 

 

Email your PersonACE_<userNumber>.java file and any
relevant supporting files (e.g., animations, sounds) to wmt@uci.edu before 3:00pm on October 21.

 

If you have any trouble, ask your classmates or email wmt@uci.edu.
