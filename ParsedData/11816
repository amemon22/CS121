					? Week 3: Resumé Workshop with Career Center
					Week 5: Women in Technology Talk by Northrop Grumman ?
				

				
					Week 4: Capgemini’s “Women in Consulting Night” (w/ SWE & ICSSC)

					
						Posted on 10/27/2013 by Angela Liu					

					
						
Wednesday, October 23rd, around 50 people attended Capgemini’s “Women in Consulting Night.” Capgemini showed a PowerPoint presentation about women in consulting and talked about their company. Afterwards, they had a panel of six consultants whom each shared their experiences at Capgemini. Near the end of the event, pizza was served as students had the chance to reach out to the Capgemini consultants and talk more about their available job and internship positions. WICS looks forward to more event opportunities with Capgemini in the future, so stay updated!
WICS would also like to thank all the people that attended despite the fact that they had midterms!
