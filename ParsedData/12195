			Hello friends!
First of all, thanks to everyone who stopped by our booth at the Anteater Involvement Fair this past Monday. We spoke with over 200 new faces, and we hope to get to know each of you better and see you throughout the year!
Today is the first day of classes for Fall Quarter 2014, and you know what that means – ICSSC’s first general meeting of the quarter is right around the corner. As we stated before, the first meeting will be:
Monday, October 6th @ 7:30 – 8:30 PM in the Mac Lab/Kay Family Foundation Lab (ICS2 Room 110)
Many of you have asked us where the Mac Lab is, and it is a somewhat difficult place to find. It’s located in Building #304 on this map of UCI’s Campus. Here’s another image that might help -

If you are walking into ICS Plaza from Aldrich Park, continue walking before you hit the stairs leading up from ICS Plaza to Engineering Plaza. From there, turn right and keep walking down along the classrooms and you will reach the Mac Lab.
I know these directions are kind of terrible. Don’t worry! If you still can’t find the lab, we’ll have some officers in the general area of the ICS plaza who can help guide you to the right place.
I’m really excited for this year, and I hope you are too  Hope to see you all on Monday!
