					ICS Banquet

					
						Posted on 06/10/2013 by Angela Liu					

					
						Wednesday, June 5th, WICS hosted their annual ICS Banquet with Debra J. Richardson (WICS club advisor) and all the ICS club (ACM, MAISS, IEEE, VGDC, ICSSC, and DATSpace) officers (old and new) to celebrate the end of a successful school year.
A delicious dinner was provided as the officers socialized and introduced themselves through slideshow presentations. Group photos were taken in the end as graduating officers congratulated newly appointed officers to get ready for another great year!
