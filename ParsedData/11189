Directions for Compiling the Codebase

Note: These directions may not correspond exactly to the
versions of software that you will be using. 
Therefore, it is important that you follow the spirit of the directions,
rather than the exact letter of them. 
If you are having trouble, please ask any classmates who are nearby, or
email me (wmt@uci.edu) and I will do my best
to help.

Make
     sure you are logged in as ACE_<usernumber>.Create
     a directory called c:\Files\ACE\ACE_<usernumber>\ on your
     machine.  If the c:\Files\ACE
     directory does not exist, please create it, then make your directory
     inside it.Locate
     the codebase zip file on the network drive in the lab –
     X:/ORIGINALS/source.zip.Copy
     the zip file to your directory.Right
     click it and “extract all” of the zip file into your directory (e.g.,
     c:/Files/ACE/ACE_01).  (It may want
     to put them in a “source” subdirectory, but if you delete the word
     “source” from the directory name, it will put them at the proper level.)Start->Software
     Develop->EclipseFile->new
     ->projectJava->Java
     Project->Next->Project
     name = ACUnclick
     use defaultDirectory:
     c:/Files/ACE/ACE_<USERNUMBER>/codeClick
     FinishIt
     may chug away for a few minutes  It
     should create a directory called bin inside the code directory.  If the bin directory is anywhere else,
     you probably typed in the directory wrong (like I did the first time!),
     right click on the AC project in Ecplise (say no when it asks you to
     delete the content), then delete the bin directory. Then go back to # 6
     and try it again, this time with the right directory.If
     asked, switch to the Java Perspective.It'll
     chug away for a bit, and the bottom window will eventually fill with a bunch
     of warnings.Change
     the filter settings by clicking on the small icon with three arrows at the
     top right of the Tasks window (bottom of eclipse screen).  Unclick
      task Click
      the box before "Where problem severity is" and click
      "error"Click
      okay, and the warnings should disappear.
 Turn
     on Window->Preferences->Java->Editor->Show Line NumbersGo
     to window->preferences-> Workbench->check "Save all modified
     resources automatically prior to manual build."The
     Tasks window should now be empty. 
     If not, we begin some compile-time debugging.***Make
     the following changes to the code: 
     In content/ac/PersonACE_01.java, lines ~75 and ~85 (both of which
     read: 

happinessSlider.setValue((int)
(happiness * 1000));

 

need to have
the following line inserted BEFORE them:

 

if
(!Demo.fullScreen)

 

      Then
save PersonACE_01.java, which should compile it.

Go
     run the demo using “Directions for Running the Demo.”
