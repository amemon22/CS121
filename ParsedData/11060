Assignment 3

Please implement a
flock of virtual creatures based on Craig Reynolds’s
paper that we read for class on Feb. 3.  You are
encouraged to use the following Java source code, which has a grid world and
creature framework already written for you.

http://www.ics.uci.edu/~wmt/courses/BiomoW04/Flock.zip

Note: In Eclipse,
set Run->Run…Parameters to Width = 500, Height = 500 for best viewing.

†

Most of the work
will need to be done in the Creature.update() method.  You are also welcome to
add methods and fields elsewhere as you see fit.

†

If you’d like a
bigger challenge, use your genetic algorithm from Assignment 2 to evolve the
rules by which the creatures flock.

Please email
wmt@uci.edu if you have any questions, and email an entire set of compiling and
well commented files to wmt@uci.edu by Monday, 2/9/04 at 5pm.
