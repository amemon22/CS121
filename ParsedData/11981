 February 27,  2015Innovative game developer Brianna Wu to discuss leading an all-women game studio Friday













MEDIA ADVISORY




 


EVENT:  Game developer Brianna Wu will speak Friday as part of UCI’s Institute for Virtual Environments and Computer Games (IVECG) Distinguished Speaker Series. Wu’s talk, “Choose Your Character: Evolution of an all-female independent game developer team,” will recount her journey into leading Giant Spacekat, an all-female game studio. Starting with the computer programming hobbyist console Playstation 1 Net Yaroze, Wu came to specialize in game design and serendipitously assembled an all-female team to build cinematic adventure game Revolution 60. In her talk, she will address the process of building a women-friendly workplace and resolving related internal and external conflicts.


Extra security will be on hand due to continued threats to Wu surrounding GamerGate.



WHEN/WHERE: 1 p.m. Friday, February 27, Donald Bren Hall 6011


INFORMATION:  Media planning to attend should contact Matt Miller at 949-824-1562 or 714-317-8771 (cell) or matt.miller@uci.edu.

 

BACKGROUND:   Brianna Wu is co-founder and head of development at Giant Spacekat, a company specializing in cinematic experiences using the Unreal game development engine (UDK). She’s also a frequent speaker on women-in-tech issues. In the past, she’s worked as a journalist and a politico.
