CueNet Demo: Visualizing Progressive Discovery [PDF] 
  
     
     Abstract: 
     We address the problem of tagging faces in personal photos. People capture 
     photos in a variety of different events like parties, trips, weddings or even conferences. 
     We have been building the CueNet framework, a context discovery framework to use EXIF 
     metadata of personal photos, and information about the owner of the photos, to discover 
     who might be participating in this event, and therefore can be present in the photo. In 
     this demonstration, we present Picatrix: an event based photo browsing web interface. 
     Users can select a photo, and see a live visualization of how our context discovery 
     algorithm, seeded with the initial information, discovers context from different data 
     sources, and uses it to tag the faces in the given photo.
