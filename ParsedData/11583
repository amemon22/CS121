WICS’s first ever Project Meeting took place on Wednesday, October 2nd, where the Project Committee began supporting the creation of websites by WICS members. Members were assigned to groups and encouraged to build their own websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Experience is not necessary as the WICS Project Committee will be tutoring HTML in each Project Meeting.
More information about the Project Development Program can be seen here. Deadline to sign up is Monday, Oct. 7th, so hurry! WICS looks forward to seeing every group at the meetings, working on their websites. Stay updated with the event calendar and Facebook for meeting times and details.
WICS looks forward to seeing what each group’s website will turn out to be like. Each member that participates will win a small prize at the end and the group with the best website will even receive a special mystery prize!
