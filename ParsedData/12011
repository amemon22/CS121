Bren School of ICS Hall of Fame Nomination Form


This fall, UCI will celebrate its 50th anniversary as one of the nation’s leading computer science schools. To honor those alums who have made a significant impact in their profession or, in other ways, have brought distinction to the School, we are creating the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences Hall of Fame.


As we solicit nominations and vet potential inaugural members, we ask for your help as a fellow graduate or as someone with a close connection to the school.


If you know of an ICS alum who should be honored in this esteemed group, please complete the nomination form below and submit prior to June 1, 2015. Nominations will be reviewed on a rolling basis and nominees will be notified by June 15, if not before.


For questions or additional information, please contact Ed Hand at elhand@uci.edu or Kristin Huerth at khuerth@ics.uci.edu.


Thank you in advance as we look forward in honoring those who have helped make us who we are today.
