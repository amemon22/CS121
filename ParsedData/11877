				Lessons learned building a new type of educational environment. The Recurse Center (formerly known as Hacker School) is a free, three-month retreat in New York City for people who want to get better at programming, whether they’ve been coding for three decades or three months. It’s self-directed, collaborative, and designed to remove as many obstacles in the way of people’s growth as possible. In this talk I’ll share what the Recurse Center is, how we’ve built it, and surprising things we’ve learned along the way.
