Undergraduate Student Policies




Remote Access


Computer systems maintained by the both the UCI Office of Information Technology and Bren School computing support accept connections only from systems which have ther names correctly registered in Domain Name System (DNS). See OIT's Limitation of Services to non-registered hosts for more details on this policy. 
For security reasons, Bren School systems always reject connections from remote hosts which do not have matching forward and reverse DNS entries. If you are having trouble telnet'ing or ftp'ing to a Bren School system while away from UCI this may be the cause of the problem.
