Final Submissions: CS 175, Winter 2015

 Due date: 5pm, Friday March 20thTeam Submission (Report and Code)One person from each team should submit all materials in a single zip file
to the "CS175 Final Report" Dropbox on EEE. This zip file should
include your final report as well as your source code. If you like, you
can also include supplemental material in this zip file called
Supplemental.pdf (or doc), i.e., a document containing additional
results such as graphs/plots that take up too much space to put in your
main report. (note that the supplemental report is completely optional
- we will focus on your main report for grading).We expect the zip file to be structured exactly like final.zip. Please download this file and fill it in with your own material. Report Format: see the online template and also consult the slides from the final lectureSource Code:
All source code should be placed in the "src" directory, along with a
README documenting the code. At the top of each source code file please
write comments explaining that file's purpose. We do not require that
you include your data since it is likely too large to upload onto
EEE. Individual ContributionEach
student needs to individually submit a document called
IndividualContribution.pdf (or .doc), which is a short 1 paragraph
summary of what your individual contribution to the project was. See
the final lecture slides for guidelines on the content. Submit to the
"Individual Contrib." Dropbox on EEE.
