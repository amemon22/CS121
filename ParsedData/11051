Game of Life
This is an implementation of John Conway's Game of Life created for Bill Tomlinson's
Biomorphic Computing course 
at the University of California, Irvine in the Winter Quarter of 2004 
in response to 
Assignment 1.
The framework of the code was written by Bill Tomlinson, and the
core functionality was written by So Yamaoka, an 
ACE student in the class.
For more information on the Game of Life, please visit 
this site.  For more information on Moore and von Neumann neighborhoods, look here.



Of particular interest is the following pattern, discovered by Alex Baker, 
an ICS student in the class.  
Draw two vertical lines-of-six, overlapping a horizontal line-of-8 so 
that the second-from-the-bottom pixels of the vertical lines overlapped 
the second-from-the-left and second-from-the-right of the horizontal line 
(see below).  It offers quite interesting results in both the von Neumann 2 
and von Neumann 3 neighboorhood functions (pull down the list where it 
says "Moore"), in particular in von Neumann 2 at step 42 ("the teddy cherub") and 49 
("the man in the egg"), and in von Neumann 3 at steps 
8 ("the raccoon") and 16 ("sad bear with suitcases").
