Overview

This course is a hands-on introduction to the process of
making real-time animated autonomous characters.  Our goal is to build characters that are intelligent, complex,
perceptive, expressive and social.  The
tools we will use to make these characters include computer programming,
computer animation and concepts from the disciplines of autonomous agents,
drama, human-computer interaction and film. 
In particular, we will focus on how to make these characters have some
of the skills of human actors.  This
course will have a significant computer programming component, but is designed
for students with no coding experience.
