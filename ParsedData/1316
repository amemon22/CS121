Michael Goodrich's Erd?s Number.



A person's 
Erd?s
number 
is the degrees of separation from that
person to the famous mathematician Paul Erd?s 
through research publications. That is, the
distance, in number of collaborations, from that person to Erd?s. 
In fact, we can define a 
collaboration graph, where we create a
vertex for each person and link two people with an edge if they have
collaborated on a published research paper. 


Michael Goodrich's Erd?s number is 3, which is realized in the
following (disjoint) ways in the collaboration graph:
 Erd?s->Avis->Snoeyink->Goodrich
 Erd?s->Pach->Bronnimann->Goodrich
 Erd?s->Pollack->Agarwal->Goodrich
 Erd?s->Alon->Vishkin->Goodrich
 Erd?s->Aronov->Kosaraju->Goodrich
 Erd?s->Wagstaff->Atallah->Goodrich
 Erd?s->Silverman->Mount->Goodrich
 Erd?s->Fraenkel->Scheinerman->Goodrich
 Erd?s->Odlyzko->Guibas->Goodrich
 Erd?s->Yao->Eppstein->Goodrich
 Erd?s->Fishburn->Tanenbaum->Goodrich

For example, Goodrich coauthored a paper with Jack Snoeyink, who
coauthored a paper with David Avis, who coauthored a paper with Paul
Erd?s.
