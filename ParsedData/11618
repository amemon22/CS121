Monday, October 14th, over 40 people attended the resumé workshop that WICS co-organized with the Career Center.
The Fall Quarter Career Fair was right around the corner and this workshop was to help students learn how to create eye-catching resumés that would land them an interview easier. Mark Carolino, the ICS School Career Counselor, gave a presentation on creating ICS-specific resumés and let both experienced and inexperienced students stand out.
