					? Spring Potluck with ICS Clubs
					WICS Final Python Project Meeting ?
				

				
					Studying and Interview Help from WICS

					
						Posted on 06/19/2014 by Angela Liu					

					
						On Thursday April 24th and May 8th, WICS hosted a Study Session that also consisted of interview help in order to prepare for upcoming midterms and career fairs.
Study groups were formed by classes, there were tutors that came by to help anyone who was struggling with specific topics.
At the same time, for those who came by for interview help, WICS prepared common tech interview questions for them to solve. Interview experience and questions were shared amongst those who have been in one before.WICS hopes that those who came got to learn something new and useful towards their classes and finding a job.
