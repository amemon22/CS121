Message from the Bren School equity advisor 

The UC Irvine campus is committed to supporting gender equity and diversity. There has never been a more important time to consider diversity in the STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) fields. The field of computer science is changing rapidly, and an academic body with a diverse background can contribute unique ideas and perspectives to the creative development and study of new technologies for a global world. However, we are still a long way from achieving this goal. To quote from a 2010 report from the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology: 

“Moreover, there is a large interest and achievement gap among some groups in STEM, and African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, and women are seriously underrepresented in many STEM fields. This limits their participation in many well-paid, high-growth professions and deprives the Nation of the full benefit of their talents and perspectives.” (pg. viii)

One of the ways we can achieve a more inclusive climate is to educate ourselves on the importance of diversity in our field. To this end, I will use this site to assemble articles that relate to issues concerning women and underrepresented minorities regarding educational achievement, advancement, pay inequity and other topics. If you have any questions regarding our equity program, or if you'd like to suggest articles for posting on this site, please send a message to advance@ics.uci.edu.


I hope you enjoy learning more about this important topic as I have. 


Your ICS equity advisor,Gloria Mark

How we compare to the rest of the nation

Here’s how the Bren School compares with the rest of the country on gender equity in terms of degrees awarded and faculty gender ratio. Data is taken from the CRA Taulbee report, 2009-10 (latest available). Though on some measures we perform better than the rest of the nation, on others we fare poorly in comparison. This data shows that we have a long way to go.
