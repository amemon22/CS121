Any d-dimensional point set
can be triangulated
with O(nceil(d/2)) simplices, none of which has
an obtuse
dihedral angle.
No bound depending only on n is possible 
if we require the maximum dihedral angle to measure at most 
90-epsilon degrees or the minimum dihedral to measure
at least epsilon.  Includes a

classification of simplices in terms of their bad angles.
