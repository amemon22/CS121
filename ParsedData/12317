iPhone demand-supply analysis
The query aims to find the best location to start a new store for iPhone 3G. In this example, e-mages corresponding to the term `iPhone' were
added for 14 days. On the other hand, the AT&T retail store locations emage was convolved with the catchment area (assumed to
be a Gaussian Kernel) for each store. The difference between the obtained `aggregate interest' and `net catchment area' images was taken to
be a representative of the `under-served interest areas' where it makes sense to open a new retail store. To find out the best location for such a
store, we undertook a convolution operation between the catchment area of a new store and this `under-served interest areas' image. The
maxima operation on the obtained image gave the most appropriate location. Note that the obtained answer in this case is not merely a pixel
location but a physical geo-location with real life semantics.
