 Michael Franz wins prestigious IEEE Computer Society awardApril 25, 2012

Read the story below or view it on the
UCIrvine Today website.



The IEEE Computer Society is honoring UCI's Michael Franz with one of five 2012 Technical Achievement Awards "for pioneering contributions to just-in-time compilation and optimization and significantly advancing Web application technology." Franz is a computer science professor in the Donald Bren School of Information & Computer Sciences and directs its Secure Systems & Languages Laboratory. He's also a professor of electrical engineering & computer science in UCI's Henry Samueli School of Engineering. Franz was a pioneer of the "trace tree" compilation technique, which became the basis of the "TraceMonkey" JavaScript engine in the Firefox browser, used by hundreds of millions of people daily. "It's always a good feeling to be recognized by one's peers and to be able to highlight the good work going on here at UC Irvine," Franz said. The society, an outgrowth of the Institute of Electrical & Electronics Engineers, is the world's leading computing membership organization. The award will be presented in Seattle in June.
