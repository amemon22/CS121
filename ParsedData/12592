Tangencies: Circular Angle Bisectors

Given any two crossing circles A and B (blue), there exist two more circles 
C and D (red) through the two crossing points, that bisect the angles made by A 
and B at those points.  If any two circles E and F (green) are tangent to 
each other, with E and F both tangent to both of A and B, then the 
tangency between E and F lies on one of C or D.  Further, if (say) the 
tangency lies on C, then C is perpendicular to both E and F.

As usual, this can be proven easily by
inversion: just invert by a 
circle centered on one of the crossing points of A and B, so that A and B 
are transformed to two crossing lines, and C and D are transformed to the 
two angle bisectors of those lines.

Note that the angle bisectors, and their property of containing the 
tangents of pairs of disks tangent to each other and to A and B, continue 
to exist even when A and B do not cross, even though in this case there is 
no longer any angle to bisect.  In this case, the existence of these 
circles is again seen by inversion, to a configuration in which A and B are 
concentric. The existence of these bisectors is especially useful for 
constructing instances of Steiner's porism, 
rings of tangent circles between two circles, since it gives a point on 
each successive tangent circle from the previous one.

If we are given any point x on C (or D), we can construct the tangent 
circles E and F using the four-circle 
property: the four circles A, E, the line L through x and the center 
of C (viewed as an infinite-radius circle), and a circle along the line 
perpendicular to L through the center of A together form a cycle of four 
tangent circles, three tangencies of which are known or easily 
constructed.  The fourth tangency, of A with E, is then the point where 
the circle through these three tangencies crosses A.  Once we have 
similarly constructed the tangency of B with E, we have three points on E 
from which the circle itself is easily found.
