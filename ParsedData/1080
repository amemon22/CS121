 Parking Information: 


        Parking is available in the Anteater Parking Structure (APS).

Once you've parked your car in APS, walk out to Peltason and turn right (toward Bison and away from APS). When you reach the stoplight/crosswalk, turn right into the campus (under the skybridge). Click 
here
for a walking map, which illustrates the path you need to take; you will pass a coffee shop called Java City on your way to Bren Hall.

Once you reach the building, enter through the tall glass stairwell. To find the elevators, walk through the stairwell, turn left and then left again.
