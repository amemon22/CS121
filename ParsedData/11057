Overview

This studio/lab course will
provide a survey of the ways in which biological systems have informed
computing, and offer hands-on examination of several main paradigms. Topics
will include practical and historical overviews of systems that resemble and/or
employ the principles of living things, for example, cellular automata, genetic
algorithms and evolutionary computing, neural networks and simulated group
behavior (ant colonies, bird flocking), among others. Several significant
implementation projects will give students first-hand engagement with the
material.
