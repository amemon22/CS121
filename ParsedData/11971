 Winter 2012 AppJamJune 19, 2012



Latest mobile app tournament focuses on self-improvement


Need to brush up on your social skills? Bren School students have an app for that. 
Following the theme of self-improvement, a team of UC Irvine undergraduates took home the latest AppJam Tournament grand prize of $1,000 with “AwkTalk,” an Android application that provides users with instant feedback on their social skills.


“The app was inspired by the initial awkwardness of being placed together to compete as a team with strangers,” said senior computer science major Vance Cagle. “Our social awkwardness led to the app’s creation, and we got straight to business from there.”



Created by Team Socially Awkward Anteaters, “AwkTalk” was one of 10 student inventions entered in the Winter 2012 edition of AppJam, a “build a fully functional app in a week” contest developed by the ICS Student Council. Teams included undergraduate and graduate students — as well as novice and advanced programmers — from the Bren School and other parts of the UCI campus.  


Second place and $500 went to the creators of “Learn UCI,” which provides voice-activated campus tours, while third place and $200 went to the team behind “Nappkin,” a mind-mapping application that allows users to note spontaneous ideas and receive insight from other users.


“The theme of self-improvement really inspired the competitors’ creative sides,” said Jerry Huynh, president of the ICS Student Council, whose members created a web application — also in one week — that instantly compiled scores to make the judging process more expedient. 


AppJam judges included faculty members Dan Frost, Shannon Tauro, Gu-Min Jeong and Nikil Dutt, as well as industry professionals Jason Leu of Kareo, Amir Banifatemi and David Cheng of K5, and Ed Cisek of MobilityWare. 







Winners:





  1st place  “AwkTalk”  

Prize: $1000 
Team Members: Vance Cagle (Computer Science), Tom Huang (Electrical Engineering), Zaheer Mohiuddin (Computer Science), Brian Payne (Computer Science), Dustin Tran (Information and Computer Science) 
App description: AwkTalk provides users with vital feedback on their social skills. The app facilitates in-person meetings where two users participate in a timed topic discussion based on their preferences, then rate each other’s social skills through the app’s prescribed categories.  
Team comment: “We were all aware that many of our colleagues in the fields of computer science and engineering (ourselves included) lack excellent social skills.”






  2nd place  “Learn UCI”  

Prize: $500 
Team Members: Yuhao Ma (Computer Science Engineering), Doug Ginther (Information and Computer Science), Kevin Jonaitis (Electrical Engineering), Kyle Boos (Information and Computer Science), Joshua Ferguson (Computer Science) 
App description: Learn UCI, or LUCI for short, implements augmented reality and voice technology to give users the ability to take pre-loaded tours of UCI or upload their own custom tours.  
Team comment: “Our app is the whole package: It allows for self-guided tours that anyone can take and provides users with interesting information about UCI. It even talks to you, and the availability of augmented reality technology is a really great feature.”






  3rd place  “Nappkin”  

Prize: $200 
Team Members: Vincent Kwok (Computer Science Engineering), Qasid Sadiq (Information and Computer Science), Rebecca De Villez (Computer Science Engineering), Ashish Patel (Information and Computer Science), Allen Roman (Computer Game Science), Edward Wu (Computer Science) 
App description: Nappkin is a mind-mapping application that allows users to spontaneously jot down ideas as they come. With Nappkin, an intuitive interface allows users to create a “bubble” to be sent out to other users for insight. 
Team comment: “Great ideas can begin anywhere, even on a napkin. In this way, our application is a virtual napkin for when inspiration strikes.”
