			WICS Mock Interviews

			
				Posted on 03/09/2014 by Angela Liu			

				
				Monday, Mar. 3rd, WICS hosted a series of mock interviews. Around 20 people signed up for this great opportunity! Representatives from participating companies such as 21st Century Fox and Northrop Grumman held one-to-one mock interviews with students. They allowed students to practice their interviewing skills and receive feedback on how to improve these skills from industry professionals.
WICS hopes to host more mock interviews in the future to allow students to have more practice for their future job or internship interviews!

			WICS LittleBits Workshops

			
				Posted on 03/07/2014 by Angela Liu			

				
				
Thursday, February 20th, WICS hosted a training workshop to teach students and potential volunteers how to use LittleBits and Snap Circuits! These simple snap on circuits are fun to play with and makes circuits easy to understand. Students enjoyed trying to create really cool things out of them and some came out to help at our LittleBits Workshop with Brownie Troops.

Monday, February 24th, 6 volunteers from WICS assisted over 20 Brownie Troops as they played around with LittleBits and Snap Circuits to build an understanding of circuits! The Brownie Troops had lots of fun using their creativity to test and make the LittleBits and Snap Circuits do entertaining things such as lighting up, changing the color of the light, making sounds, and so on.
WICS is looking forward to working more with Brownie Troops! Volunteers are welcome anytime to join the fun experience!

			Studying with WICS

			
				Posted on 02/17/2014 by Angela Liu			

				
				Over 20 people came on Monday, February 10th to join WICS for a study session. Topics such as ICS 45C, ICS 6B, and many other classes were being covered by some students that were willing to help teach those in need of help. Popcorn and soda were provided by WICS to help replenish some lost brain cells in the process. Even though it was a study session, there were still some socializing and de-stressing involved.
WICS would like to thank all those that came to help others in their studying and hope that everyone did well on their midterms!

			Brownie Troops Computer Expert Badge

			
				Posted on 02/17/2014 by Angela Liu			

				
				On Sunday, February 9th, 6 volunteers from WICS came out to help 7 Brownie Troops with earning their Computer Expert Badge! It was an educational yet fun day for the Brownies; they got to experience using computers to paint a picture, take a virtual museum tour, play an online game, and much more! (To see more details, see their event website) This was an insightful experience for the volunteers as well, seeing that the 6-8 year old girls having a lot more knowledge on computers compared to phones; it looks like there is a new generation of Computer Scientists!
The workshop was very successful and WICS plans to do more with girl scouts in the future to continue teaching young girls about technology.

			WICS Co-hosts Google Panel

			
				Posted on 01/20/2014 by Angela Liu			

				
				Around 62 people signed in on Thursday, January 16th, for the Google Panel. WICS invited female Googlers to talk about what it is like to work there, capabilities needed for applying, as well as ways of applying. One of the speakers that came, trains other Googlers to interview applications and gave WICS some really good interview advice.
         « prev      1   2      next »  (8 Photos)
The two speakers talked about how Google is doing their best in decreasing the gender inequality. There are many benefits to working at Google such as flexible schedules, maternity and paternity leave, and even asking for promotions. Due to the limited space in the room, many people were unable to attend the panel. However, Google set up a booth outside the DBH building the next day for further questions and advice for people who were unable to go to the panel. Apply for Google by going on google.com/jobs/students!
WICS would like to give a big thanks to the recruiter, Alec Fox, for organizing this event.

			First WICS Meeting of Winter ’14

			
				Posted on 01/11/2014 by Angela Liu			

				
				Thursday, January 10, 2014. Are you tired of going to parties and thinking to yourself, “Uggh, what a sausage fest? Like seriously, enough with the testosterone! Where my ladies at?” FEAR NOT, women in computer science, because on this unassuming Thursday night, 40+ beautiful ladies who are pursuing a career in an emerging field that offers excellent job stability gathered to throw the most epic of ragers. There was pizza; there was soda; there were animal crackers, board games, and there was even a powerpoint presentation! Dancing Queen WICS’s President Angela Li teased us with events to come. Projects committee chairwomen announced this quarter’s Android App Development extravaganza, and someone even ALMOST built a hotel on Boardwalk in the first forty minutes of Monopoly. If you made the mistake of not attending, don’t be sad. There will be another! Check Facebook for updates about WICS! Happy Week 1!
