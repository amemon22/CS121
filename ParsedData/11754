					First Android App Development Meeting

					
						Posted on 02/04/2014 by Angela Liu					

					
						Thursday, January 30th, more than 80 people attended the WICS Project Meeting to learn about developing Android apps! 20 teams were formed for this 5-week tutorial session. On this day, the WICS website obtained a record of 202 views in one day! Many non-ICS majors such as Chemistry, Public Health Science, PSB (Psych and Social Behavior), and International Studies; WICS hopes everyone that joined will get to have fun as well as gain knowledge to produce awesome apps in the future! Prizes will be raffled off to the participating teams in the end of the sessions, don’t miss any meetings! PPTs are posted here for people that were unable to attend. Good luck to all the teams and WICS looks forward to seeing all the finished projects on Week 9!
