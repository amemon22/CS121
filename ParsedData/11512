SMART-ICS credit transfer program




SMART-ICS is a program that encourages partnership with area community colleges in an effort to provide student transfers to ICS subject credit for all lower division math and ICS courses required for the ICS degree. 
The Bren School currently has SMART-ICS agreements with:              
 » Fullerton College
                » Long Beach Community College
                » Orange Coast College
Students should contact the community college they are interested in attending to learn about  its SMART program.
FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE ADMINISTRATORS
              
              SMART Reasoning
    The typical community college student transfers to UC Irvine's Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences with a junior standing in terms of units completed. 
Yet, because of the difficulty of articulating community college computer science and discrete math courses to ICS' requirements, most of those transferring into the ICS major receive limited ICS course transfer credit. 
To complete the missing courses often requires a transfer student to spend more time (and money) to obtain an ICS degree than a student who entered UCI as a freshman ICS major.
SMART Program
    SMART-ICS, Standardized Major Requirements to Transfer into Information and Computer Science, is a new articulation program that allows community college students to meet the lower-division computer science and mathematics course requirements of the ICS major by covering designated topics and meeting a programming proficiency requirement, rather than by a series of course-to-course articulations. 
Transfer students completing the SMART-ICS requirements come to the ICS major immediately prepared to begin upper-division courses in ICS. SMART-ICS does not affect ICS' course-to-course articulation options; they are still in place and available.
SMART Steps
    Most community colleges will satisfy SMART-ICS by specifying a group of courses that a student will complete. Still, SMART-ICS is about topic coverage: ICS will accept any SMART program that reasonably ensures satisfaction of the SMART-ICS requirements. In particular, if you wish, your school can have multiple programs that meet the SMART requirements.
To guide your community college in developing its SMART programs, please refer to the SMART Chart. 
The Chart lists each topic to be covered and, as a guide to the depth of coverage, the number of lecture hours to devote to it; it also spells out the programming proficiency requirement.
Community colleges interested in partnering with ICS in its SMART-ICS program follow four simple steps:
Notify ICS of your interest in participating in SMART-ICSCreate your SMART programs, using the SMART Chart as your guideObtain ICS certification of your programsCertify your transfer students when they complete one of your SMART programs
