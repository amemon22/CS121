Information Sessions






On a quarterly basis, the Bren School invites members of the corporate community to Bren Hall to make a recruiting presentation to computing and engineering students.  Each information session spotlights one company.


Companies benefit from participation in a number of ways:

Your company receives heightened exposure among Bren School students.
   Your human resources personnel have the opportunity to meet potential candidates in a relaxed and informal setting.
   Students receive a chance to educate themselves about your company.


Information sessions are usually scheduled from 12:00 – 1:00 p.m.  or 5:00-7:00 p.m. throughout each quarter.  During the first 20–30 minutes, company representatives give a general overview of the company, highlighting aspects such as company culture and employment opportunities.  The next 15-20 minutes are used as a formal question and answer period.  The remaining time is dedicated to informal conversation and resume collection.  During this time, students often speak one-on-one with company representatives to ask further questions.


CURRENTLY These sessions are free of charge; however, most companies choose to provide pizza and sodas to encourage student participation.  

 

For more details or to set up an Information Session, please contact 
Delian Petrov, the ICS Student Council Corporate Outreach Chair, at
