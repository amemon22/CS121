WICS has recently been announced as a winner of the Symantec sponsored Round 5 Student Seed Fund award from the National Center of Women & Information Technology (NCWIT)! As a winner, WICS will receive $750 to host a series of “Hacker” workshops for girls in elementary schools and middle schools to generate their interest in technology early on.
The announcement for the award can be seen here.
Thank you to both Symantec and NCWIT for this generous award!
