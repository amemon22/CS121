Prospective Graduate Students




Welcome!
Join more than 400 graduate students studying virtually
every principle area within the fields of Computer Science, Informatics and
Statistics, as well as many new interdisciplinary topics. With more than 70 faculty members spanning three departments—Computer Science, Informatics and Statistics—a state-of-the-art 90,000 sq.
ft. building and a $20 million gift from philanthropist Donald Bren, this is a
very exciting time to be a part of the Bren School.
Almost
all of our Ph.D. students receive financial aid in the form of teaching
assistantships or research assistantships during their time at UC Irvine. Many
of them also receive fellowships from the Bren School's corporate partners and
private supporters.
You
can still apply to the Bren School if your undergraduate degree is not in the
same area as the graduate degree in which you are interested. However, it is
helpful if you have taken courses in computer science and math, and/or have
some related work experience.
