Undergraduate degree in Informatics




DEGREES AVAILABLE: Major and Minor 

  
 What is Informatics? 

				Informatics brings together software engineering, human-computer 
interaction, and the study of information technology in organizations 
into a single, focused degree program.				
Informatics addresses the design and construction of 
information technology systems that will be effective in real-world 
situations.  It includes not only building software but also examining 
the human, organizational, and social context where the system will be 
used. 
Informatics is the interdisciplinary study of the design, 
implementation, use, and impact of information technology.
Informatics is a common term for computer science in 
European universities; the number of Informatics programs in American 
universities is growing.
Traditional computer science programs focus on analyzing and 
designing computers and computer systems, but the success of those 
systems depends not only on their intrinsic characteristics but also on 
the real-world situations where they will be used—the human users and 
their requirements, characteristics, and organizations. Informatics 
studies computer systems in their real-world context and how to design 
and build those systems so they work effectively in that context. 
In Informatics we aim to:
Design and develop new uses for information technology.Understand the effect information technology has on 
people.Apply information technology in fields ranging from 
medicine to music, from ecology to aerospace, from finance to 
entertainment.

Is Informatics for me? 
Informatics is for you if you:
Enjoy solving problems using all the tools you have available.
Can work not only with technical details but also with 
“big-picture” issues
Have strong reading and writing skills and can think freely, 
creatively, and systematically.
Previous experience in computer programming is not required to 
start the Informatics major. Programming is just one aspect of 
Informatics and the major introduces all the necessary skills at a 
manageable pace. Students who do already have some programming 
experience will also find new concepts, even in the very first course. 
The Informatics major offers a contemporary curriculum with an 
emphasis on group work (starting in the first course), studio-oriented 
design courses, and a year-long senior project.
The first year of the program provides students with a hands-on 
introduction to the broad field of Informatics, centering on the 
Informatics Core Course. This year-long course develops students’ basic 
understanding of software: how to design and construct programs and how 
the programs operate as part of information technology systems.
The second year builds up a portfolio of foundational concepts 
and techniques that establish the discipline of Informatics; these 
contribute to the “toolbox” students will use in subsequent years to 
solve large-scale information and software design problems.  As 
sophomores, students begin to take more advanced courses that support 
their specialization in either software engineering, human-computer 
interaction, or the study of organizations and information technology. 
These may involve courses in Management, Psychology, Computer Science, 
or Engineering.
In the third year, all students study the design process, 
project management, and the impacts of technology on the real world. 
Students continue to take electives in their specialized area of study.
The fourth year is built around a year-long capstone project in 
which groups of students address a significant project, typically from 
an outside client.

What do I take? 
All Informatics majors take a common core of 16 
courses. After their first year, Informatics majors choose an additional
 10 courses in one of three specializations:
Software EngineeringHuman-Computer InteractionOrganizations and Information Technology
For a full listing of courses required for the major, see the General Catalogue.
Students are encouraged to consult an academic advisor 
in the Bren School of ICS to determine the coursework designed to meet 
their educational goals. 
Additional information about this degree can be found 
on the Department of
 Informatics web site.

What can I do with this degree?  
A degree in Informatics provides excellent preparation for 
work at the forefront of the computing industry.               
              
Our students work in many industrial settings, such
 as start-up companies, small software houses, consulting firms and 
multi-national corporations.               
              
They are prepared for careers including these:
Software EngineerHuman-Computer Interface DesignerInformation ArchitectGame DesignerUsability EngineerMobile Computing Systems Designer
Many students will go on to graduate school in computer 
engineering, computer science, information science, management or law.

What can I do with the Informatics Minor?
The minor provides a focused study of Informatics to 
supplement a student’s major program of study and prepares students for a
 profession, career, or academic pursuit in which information and 
software design is an integral part but is not the primary focus. 
The minor allows students sufficient flexibility to 
pursue courses that complement their major field or address specific 
interests. The minor particularly centers on understanding the 
relationships among computers and people, and how these relationships 
must be addressed in information and software design. 
Requirements for the Informatics minor can be found in the General Catalogue.
