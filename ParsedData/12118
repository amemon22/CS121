Software Engineering (SE) (M.S. and Ph.D.)


The field of Software Engineering is concerned with the creation and
analysis of the complex software systems that underlie modern society.
Research in Software Engineering targets software artifacts and the
people that create them. The field is large, and it encompasses
engineering design research, i.e. the creation of new software artifacts
with some desirable properties, as well as empirical research, i.e. the
study of the effects that software development tools and methods have in
the context of software development teams. Topics include software
architectures, testing and debugging, software development tools, formal
languages, requirements engineering, mining of large software-related
data sources, reverse engineering, and development processes.


The Ph.D. degree in Software Engineering (SE) offers students
opportunities for graduate study in the spectrum of intellectual
activity in SE. The M.S. degree in SE complements undergraduate
knowledge in related fields with a solid framework for understanding the
development of complex software systems.
