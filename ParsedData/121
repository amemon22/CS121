Tech Talks






On a quarterly basis, the Bren School invites members of the corporate community to Bren Hall to make a technical presentation to computing and engineering faculty and graduate students.  Each talk spotlights one company.


Companies benefit from participation in a number of ways:

Your company receives heightened exposure among Bren School faculty and graduate students.
   Your company representatives have the opportunity to meet faculty and graduate students in a relaxed and informal setting based upon interests in certain research areas.


Tech Talks are usually scheduled from 12:00 – 1:30 p.m. throughout each quarter.  During this time, a senior technical representative or technology VP from your company presents on research topics and items of interests, such as software engineering, user interfaces, security and privacy to name a few.
