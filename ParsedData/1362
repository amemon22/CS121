    Course Goals 

To develop an understanding of efficiency of algorithms,
to learn some algorithmic design techniques,
and to analyze the complexity of the amount of resources required
by algorithms for a variety of applications.

    Grading 
    Policies
      10% -- homework submissions
      20% -- several quizzes (notification given in a previous class lecture)
      30% -- two midterm examinations (Tu of week 4, Th of week 7)
      40% -- final exam (Th Aug 27 at 10am)
      To pass the course you must pass the final exam and
          have an overall passing average
      Instances of academic dishonesty will be reflected
          in the final grade because dishonesty devalues the
          learning experience for the whole class
   

    Other Course-Related Information

The following material is from previous years' offerings of 161.
Some of these offerings were based on different texts (Baase and
Cormen-Leiserson-Rivest), and covered a somewhat different range of
topics.  You may find this material useful, but it is not required reading.

    Lecture notes from Winter 1996
        Sample exams from Winter 1998 and Spring 2005
