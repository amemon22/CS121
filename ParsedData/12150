					Fall Quarter Update

We’ve been so busy planning our Fall, Winter, and conference events that our blog has fallen by the wayside!
Here is an overview of the rest of our events from Fall Quarter 2012:
• Web Development workshop with Anthony Alagna (Slides from the  workshop are here)
• A “Study, Dinner and De-Stress Night” with tutors for ICS 30 (Python)
• Thanksgiving Potluck and showing of The Avengers — in collaboration with MAISS
• Caffeine Potluck in Collaboration with DATSpace (before finals!)
Students continued to enthusiastically participate in WICS events, with attendance between 25-50 members at every event. We collaborated with other groups, and we’re beginning to establish a more unified tech community among the students at UCI!
We have a lot of plans for Winter Quarter and even better: our Southern California Women in Tech Conference, April 14th!
