 Welcome Week 2014October 20, 2014

A rollicking scavenger hunt helps introduce new ICS students to campus







With blue-shirted ICS Student Council (ICSSC) members in the lead, a procession of hundreds of eager freshman and transfer students traverse the paved roads of Aldrich Park. It’s about 3:30 p.m. on Sept. 29, and day one of Welcome Week at UC Irvine is winding down.


The students — representing a sizeable chunk of the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences’ approximately 700 total incoming undergraduates — wend their way toward ICS Plaza. They’ve just finished with the Dean’s Undergraduate Welcome at the Student Center and now, ICSSC and other ICS student organizations have something fun planned for them: a scavenger hunt.


The students organize into teams of five. They’re tasked with a hunt that includes “find an officer from a club and tell them your favorite algorithm or programming language” and “program ‘Hello World’ at ICS 364,” among 31 other objectives — and they have only 30 minutes. 


Those minutes whir by as the students scramble to “find the wandering Pikachu” (an ICSSC member in the Pokémon character’s costume) and “find the Android PuzzleBots in the Mac Lab,” with an invitation to keep the toy figurines.


Knots of students rush back into ICS Plaza as time runs out. Laughing, they line up for prizes, the highest-scoring teams getting first pick from several boxes of overflowing Google swag.


The Dean’s Undergraduate Welcome was held in the Student Center’s Pacific Ballroom to accommodate the legion of students. While lingering outside the ballroom before the event started, business information management freshman Tiffany Tanuwidjaja related her family history with computer science at UC Irvine. “My dad studied computer science here in the 1980s, before there was an actual computer science school. It has grown a lot,” she said. She’s right: In the last five years, ICS has seen 150 percent growth.


In addition to growth, Dean Hal Stern remarked on the flexibility of a career at ICS. “Computing has emerged to become central everywhere on campus,” he explained. And, of course, there are the perks, including access to a 3D printer at the Francisco J. Ayala Science Library.


ICS student organizations took the stage with their recruitment pitches, in case new undergraduates missed the chance to mingle at the Anteater Involvement Fair. 
ACM at UC Irvine 
president Gio Borje opened with the organization’s honorable mention at the 2014 International Collegiate Programming Contest World Finals held in Ekaterinburg, Russia. “That’s kind of what we do,” he quipped.


Earlier in the day, the new undergraduates mingled with campus organization leaders and members at the Anteater Involvement Fair in Aldrich Park, which ran from midmorning to late afternoon. ICS clubs took up nearly an entire row of tables and booths, with the row’s lone non-ICS organization having to shout, “Anyone who is not an ICS major, check us out!”


Video Game Development Club (VGDC) was among the most popular tables for new ICS majors, despite being separated from ICS row. “We’ve had random influxes of people all day. We scream ‘Hey, we make games!’ and they flock,” VGDC member Tyler Nutsathitya said.


ICSSC president Delian Petrov was on double-duty, representing both ICSSC and the newly revamped 
Google Student Ambassador program at UCI. Swarmed by incoming ICS majors, Petrov handed out information about the two organizations and Google promotional items — including sunglasses and pens — in almost equal doses.


Kenny Lennon, a freshman majoring in computer game science, was among the crowd of students. When asked why he chose UC Irvine, he explained, “I love it here. It was my first choice, because it’s one of the only schools with a computer game science major, and unlike UCLA, there’s no hills.”


“I want to join VGDC, but so do a couple hundred other students, apparently,” Lennon laughed, referring to VGDC’s perpetually busy booth. 


In addition to the 700 undergraduates, ICS welcomed nearly 200 graduate students at an early-morning orientation introducing students to the abundant resources available to them, including ICS-specific computing support and research possibilities.


“Today is one of the few days I dress up,” Associate Dean of Student Affairs Tony Givargis joked with the master’s and doctoral students. “Usually I’m the skinny guy in a T-shirt on a bicycle.” He urged the students to approach him with any questions or problems, assuring them that if he didn’t have the answers, he’d know where to find them.


Dean Stern took the podium to applaud the group. “While we love our undergraduates, the reputation of UC Irvine is determined by the quality of our faculty and graduate students,” he said.


“Have a great X years,” he joked on his way out.


However long their stay at ICS might end up lasting, all of Fall 2014’s new graduate and undergraduate students can thank the school’s hardworking Student Affairs Office team for a Welcome Day that got things started off right.
