 To be or not to be
October 25, 2013The spooky side of science











Read the excerpt below or view the full story on the UCI website.






The ghosts of Facebook: Although we all one day will shuffle off this mortal coil, our digital identity will live on through our social networks. Jed Brubaker, a Ph.D. candidate in informatics, explores why “to be, or not to be” is no longer a question.


“The mass adoption of social network sites includes, as a natural consequence, the growing presence of profiles representing individuals who are no longer alive,” he explains on his website.


“However, the death of a user does not result in the elimination of his or her account nor the profile’s place inside a network of digital peers. Indeed, the fact that friends use a user’s profile page, postmortem, to say last goodbyes, share memories and coordinate funereal arrangements is well known, if not frequently discussed. Death plays an increasingly significant role, then, in the experience of social networking.”


Hamlet couldn’t have said it better.
