Research

Our group works on computer vision, machine learning, and  computer graphics, with a focus on statistical methods for analyzing images and video. Our research tends to explore theoretical issues (such as knowlege representation and large-scale learning) that are firmly grounded in concrete applications (such as visual search and video surveillance). Historically, it has been difficult to transfer algorithms that work in controlled lab settings to unconstrained ``in-the-wild'' footage. Our current work attempts to bridge this divide with a focus on machine learning and geometric models. Machine learning allows one to learn models that reflect the subtle statistical regularities of the visual world, leveraging large-scale visual datasets that are now readily available. Computer graphics provides the basis for structured, geometric representations, important for capturing the complexity of visual phenomena present in real-world data.



Here's a formal bio and a sampling of recent projects we've worked on:
 Object recognition (PASCAL VOC Lifetime Achievement Prize)
   Discriminative models in vision (2009  Marr Prize) 

  Finding and tracking people in images/videos (book chapter)
    Special IJCV issue on Video Representations for Visual Recognition (deadline of June 14, 2014)
