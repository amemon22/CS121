 Mentorship program makes a strong impression in its first year
June 13, 2014










Engineering Dean Gregory Washington, Linda Smart, Rachel Weiner and ICS Dean Hal Stern.




At a spirited June event in the Student Center’s Pacific Ballroom, a group of students from both the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences and the Samueli School of Engineering gathered with their mentors to celebrate a successful end to the two schools’ inaugural Undergraduate Mentorship Program.


In its first year, the Undergraduate Mentorship Program focused primarily, though not exclusively, on pairing up female ICS and Engineering students with mentors in a variety of high-tech businesses. The proportion of women in STEM fields (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), both in academia and industry, continues to lag behind that of men. This led to the decision to begin the program with a focus on women. 


Linda Smart — senior director of R&D informatics services at Allergan, an ICS and School of Biological Sciences alumna, and a member of ICS/Engineering Diversity Committee — was instrumental in the launch of the mentoring program.


“I had a real personal interest,” Smart says. “It’s a way for me to sort of reach back in time, think about who I was as student, and say, ‘How can I give young students benefit of my experience?’”


Antigone Blackwell, director of development for both ICS and Engineering, says that the two schools have a strong interest not only in recruiting more female students in the first place, but also retaining those students once they arrive.


“The attrition rate is higher among women,” Blackwell says. “A mentorship program was seen as a cost-effective way to encourage women to stay in the Bren and Samueli schools by showing them how to make a successful transition from the academic world to the working world.”


As part of the program, all mentors conducted mock interviews with their mentees, reviewed their resumes and engaged them in career-track discussions. Many mentors brought their mentees out for site visits at their workplaces. All of the mentors emphasized networking, Smart says, “but the mentoring was always very specific. It’s very personal between mentor and the mentee.”


Rachel Weiner, a computer science/informatics double major who just finished her sophomore year, was paired up with Smart as her mentor. “I like the idea of having a mentor who is in the computer science field and a woman,” Weiner says. “That shows women that it’s doable to get into computer science.”


While structural and cultural hurdles certainly exist for women in STEM fields, “We put our own barriers up,” Weiner says. “Mentally, we might think we’re not as good. Knowing that you’re good enough, and being able to believe in yourself, makes a huge difference.”


As a first step for the two schools in addressing the retention of talented engineers and computer scientists, “I’m very excited about where we ended up,” Smart says. “These young ladies are amazing: very smart, hard-working, showed great initiative. I enjoyed interacting with them. I hope it was rewarding for the mentees, because I know it was extremely rewarding for all of the mentors.”


Next year, Blackwell says, the program will increase from 42 mentors to some 75 mentors, and the emphasis will expand as well. “We have been recruiting not only women, but students from other underrepresented groups,” she says. 


“I would recommend the program to anyone,” Weiner says. “It opens you up to networking and mentorship, which can be hard to find otherwise.”


Blackwell also notes that four of the senior students in the Undergraduate Mentorship Program were hired by their mentor’s company, and that several other students have been offered internships through the connections they made in the mentorship program. “Our students have made a strong impression,” she says. “And the program has clearly been mutually beneficial for our industry partners.”
