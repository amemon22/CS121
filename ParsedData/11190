Assignment 2

The goal of this assignment is to guide you through the
process of creating a new java file where you will be working for the next
several weeks. 

 

Open Eclipse.  Follow
the directions for compiling and running the code, if you haven’t already done
so.

 

Make sure you go to window->preferences-> check
"Save all modified resources automatically prior to manual
build."  

 

Open PersonACE_xx.java, and save it as PersonACE_<INSERT YOUR
USER NUMBER HERE>.java.  Insert your
name at ~line 32.  Change the two
occurrences of “xx” (~lines 37 and 48) to be your user number.  Uncomment the print statement at ~line 69,
inserting your user number.  Save the
file.  It should compile the file.  (If there are any errors, they will appear in
the bottom window.  If nothing appears,
compilation was successful.)

 

Make the changes described around line 72 in Demo.java.  (*** In addition to changing the 01’s to your
number, you also need to change NUM_PEOPLE[1] to be NUM_PEOPLE[yourNumber].) Save
it.  It should compile the file.  (If there are any errors, they will appear in
the bottom window.  If nothing appears,
compilation was successful.)

 

Copy the two animations that you made for Assignment 1 into
the art/anims directory.  They should
replace the two dance animations already there.

 

Run the demo from a command prompt, using the directions
that were handed out.  The command line
to run your demo is:

“runner –numPeople <insert user number here> 1”  So, for example, I would type:

“runner –numPeople 01 1”.

 

With the demo (graphics) window running and both it and the
command window visible on screen, take a screen shot of the system (see below)
and email it to me as a gif or jpg.

 

To take a screenshot, open Photoshop and leave it in the
background.  (***Some machines may need
to be restarted before Photoshop will work.) 
Arrange the screens in the way you’d like them to appear.  Press Ctrl-PrntScrn, which will copy an
image of the entire screen to the clipboard. 
Switch over to Photoshop.  Hit
Ctrl-N for a new file.  Once it’s open,
hit Ctrl-V to paste the contents of the clipboard into the new file.  Then you can Save As a jpg or gif.  Email it to wmt@uci.edu
before 3:00pm on October 14.

 

If you have any trouble, ask your classmates or email wmt@uci.edu and I’ll do my best to help.
