Call a pentagon 'parallel' if every diagonal is parallel to its opposite side.
e.g., for ABCDE, AB // EC, etc.
Now, given three of the vertices, say A, B, C, construct the points D and E, 
so that ABCDE is a parallel pentagon.

I did this by first constructing a regular pentagon, and then applying some
linear transformations, but I'd like to see an elegant solution.
