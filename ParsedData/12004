Graduate Funding & Housing




Fellowships for ICS Graduate Students
Fellowship and award opportunities available to ICS Graduate Students are outlined in this 
PDF document.
This is a combined list of those offered by Graduate Division and external sources. Please see the links provided in the document for more information on each fellowship or award.
*Many fellowships have internal department deadlines 7-10 days prior to the official due date. 
 
Teaching Assistantships
Students can receive funding through appointments as a Teaching Assistant (TA) or Reader. Information on responsibilities, requirements, and benefits can be found on the Graduate Division website here.
Interested ICS graduate students must submit an application for each quarter they wish to search as a TA or Reader. The application requirement applies to ALL students, including those on a TA/Reader fellowship.
Students are notified of their appointments via email as soon as they are assigned. Any questions about TA and Reader assignments should be directed to the Department Managers.
 
Graduate Housing
On-campus housing is not guaranteed. 
All students looking for on-campus housing options must apply in order to be considered. Continuing students may apply to the housing waiting list at any time during the year. Admitted students may apply for housing after they submit their Statement of Intent to Register (SIR), and must do so by May 1st.
Continuing students can find more information on the Student Housing website here.
Information for new graduate students may be found here.
