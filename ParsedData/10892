Complete Datapath
Design

 

Lab 5

 

Please
read ALL instructions carefully. Only properly
submitted assignments will be graded. Make sure to create a zipfile, named by your student id, and submit required files
in it. 

 

Specification



 

In this
lab you will complete the design of the data path by adding all the hardware
necessary to support LD, ST, BNE, BEQ, and JMP instructions, as well as support
for executing the I-format ALU instructions. The instructions in the following
table should be implemented in your design. Reuse as much of the Lab 4 datapath
as you can, adding a memory, IR, PC, MDR, multiplexers, sign extenders, etc.

 



 

Please
turn in a block diagram of the data path. 

 

Design

Your
task is to design the complete datapath and a testbench to test the
functionality of the module.

The
template VHDL files for the module (lab5.vhd), global
declaration package (Glob_dcls.vhd) and memory module (Mem.vhd) have been
provided to you. The interface (that is, ports) is already defined. You need to
design the architecture for both. Do not make any change to the interface.


 

Please
see the updated glob_dcls.vhd here. Line
21 has been modified. The range should be "0 to 31" instead of
"31 downto 0".

 

Verification

You
need to test the following:

Instruction
     fetchLoad (load
     address computation + actual load from memory) Store
     (store address computation + actual store to memory)Branch
     Equal/Not Equal.

Generate
the control signals at the right time in your testbench for each test case. Use
a clock cycle of 40 ns. 

 

Submission:

Please
submit the specification by Monday, May 12 at 11:45pm 

1. A block diagram of the complete
datapath

 

Please
submit your design and verification by Monday, May 19 at 11:45pm

2. VHDL design and test bench

3. Screenshots of Waveform 

 

Both
the implementation and test code will be graded. You will also be graded on
coding style and code comments.
