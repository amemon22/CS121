Ph.D. Program Overview




The Bren School offers Ph.D. degrees in Computer Science, Information
and Computer Science, Software Engineering, Networked Systems, and Statistics.
The Ph.D. programs are research oriented and encourage students to
collaborate with faculty to solve advanced problems in computer science. The
programs are full-time and usually take six years to complete. Different
degrees/concentrations may have different normative times to degree. For the most current information, students
should check the General Catalogue for their area.

» Ph.D. Exams and Reviews
Graduate Student Review
At the end of each spring quarter, a formal
review is conducted of all Ph.D. students. If unsatisfactory progress is being made, a
letter of probation will be sent to the student and placed in their file. The
probation period varies, depending on the individual student's academic
situation. If the problem is not cleared during the probation period, the ICS
Graduate Office may recommend dismissal from the program. It is the student's responsibility to make sure the
ICS Graduate Office is aware of any problem that has been cleared during the
probation period.
Teaching Requirement
All Ph.D. students are required to participate in teaching activities
for two quarters. Summer teaching or teaching at another university may be
accepted in fulfillment of this requirement. Students who fulfill this
requirement with a teaching assistantship at UCI are required to take an
orientation course, ICS 398A, enroll in four units of ICS 399 each quarter they
serve as a TA, and attend the TA training program during Welcome Week.
Advancing to Candidacy for the M.S.
Ph.D. students can advance to Candidacy for the M.S. degree, unless the
student already holds an M.S. degree in Computer Science or a related field.
Advancement to candidacy implies that a student is almost finished with his/her
degree requirements. Students must advance to candidacy at least one quarter
prior to degree conferral.
Students with a Previously Earned M.S.
ICS students with an M.S. degree from another university who are
working towards their Ph.D. may qualify to receive credit for required courses
if their previous M.S. degree was in computer science or a closely related
field. Course equivalency will be determined by the ICS Associate Dean for
Student Affairs following a written recommendation from the student's advisor.
Advisors may require that students take additional courses when appropriate.
Final approval will be determined by the Dean of Graduate Division.
Advancing to Candidacy for the Ph.D.
The advancement exam is an oral presentation to a five-member
committee. The student should identify the members
who will be on their dissertation committee, obtain the all required signatures, and pay the advancement fee before submitting the candidacy form. When the Dean of Graduate Division has approved
advancement, the ICS Graduate Office will notify the student.
Final Defense
For the final dissertation defense, students should email the ICS
Graduate Office with the date, time and location for the defense, the names of
their committee members, and the title and abstract of their dissertation. This
should be done no less than two weeks before the defense. This information will
be sent to all ICS graduate students and faculty. In addition to the student's
committee members, anyone else who wishes to attend the defense may do so. 
The completed dissertation and signed forms is submitted
to the UCI Special Collections & Archives in paper or electronic format. Graduate Division will notify students once their degree
has been conferred.
