CS 145A/B - Embedded Computing Systems
Prof. Tony Givargis

Embedded systems include almost any computing system other than
traditional computers.  Examples include cell phones, set-top
boxes, medical devices, alarm systems, automotive systems,
portable music players, etc.  Embedded systems is one of the
fastest growing areas in computing, having high impact on
people's lives, and with tremendous potential for innovative
new products.  If you think about it, many of the most exciting
computing systems today are embedded systems -- iPods and
iPhones, Mars rovers, Wii video game consoles, GPS-based people
trackers, and more.  The embedded systems landscape is one of
tremendous innovation and impact -- new inventions, many from
students like yourselves, come about every day.
