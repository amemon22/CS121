Sponsored Internship Program






What it is:

The Sponsored Internship Program offers companies a unique opportunity to enhance their workforce by hand-selecting undergraduate seniors or graduate-level students from the Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences to complete internships at their companies.  This very popular and successful program also serves as a cost effective recruitment tool for highly qualified IT professionals.


How it works:

Participating companies submit criteria for desired internship. They then receive background information on Bren School students who have expressed interest in company internships. 
   Companies rank the students whose credentials best match their employment needs, while students rank the sponsoring companies in a similar fashion.  
   Bren School personnel review these two sets of rankings and make matches that best reflect the interests and needs of both parties.  
   Companies interview the candidate/s and, should the match be mutually agreeable, offer a paid internship during the summer and/or academic year, as well pay for the student’s fees. 
   The financial terms of the internship are negotiated directly between the student and the sponsoring company.

Students are expected to maintain a minimum GPA of 2.8 (undergraduate) and 3.3 (graduate) during their involvement in the sponsored internship program.


How to participate:

In order to participate in this program, each company pays a tax-deductible donation to the Bren School, which covers the cost of the student’s annual fees.

Undergraduate Resident Fees donation:  $15,500*
   Graduate Resident Fees donation:  $16,500*

*Amounts may vary based on fee increases and/or if the desired student is a non-resident.
