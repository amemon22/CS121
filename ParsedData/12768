With the Holcombs at Heritage Park

We brought a takeout sushi picnic dinner with the plan of watching the free movie in the park;
after dinner, Diana and Michal took the dog for a walk while the kids played in the playground
and Tyler and I played with my camera.  But then we found out that it was a dive-in movie at the
swimming pool, so instead we went out for ice cream and boba tea.
