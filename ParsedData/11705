Undergraduate degree in Business Information Management




DEGREES AVAILABLE: Major
			    Offered jointly with The Paul Merage School of Business 
 
  
As the business environment becomes increasingly global and 
information-centric, the need has increased for graduates who understand
 and can use  technology that gathers and provides information, who are 
able to distill and recognize patterns in that information, and who can 
apply those analyses to achieve business objectives. 
The undergraduate Business Information Management (BIM) major 
administered by the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer 
Sciences is a collaborative, interdisciplinary degree program between 
the Bren School and The Paul Merage School of Business. 
It seeks to educate students to understand and then apply the 
theories and concepts of a broad, integrated curriculum covering 
computing, informatics, business fundamentals and analytical 
decision-making.
