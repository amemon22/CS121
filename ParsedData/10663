Achondroplasia The Most Familiar Source Of Dwarfism Dwarfism  Achondroplasia effects roughly two out of every 100,000 live births and is associated with advancing paternal age (more than 35 years old). Whilst life span and intelligence are normal, in infancy kids frequently have low tone and are slow to meet developmental milestones, such as crawling and walking. Additionally, infants with achondroplasia are at danger of death due to spinal cord and/or upper airway obstruction. In childhood, obesity may be an issue.

Leg-lengthening is an extremely controversial treatment that entails numerous surgeries, pain and possible infections. Many adults with achondroplasia view the leg-lengthening procedure as unnecessary at very best and as an affront to their humanity at worst.
