 Congratulations, Class of 2014June 19, 2014















Bren School confers 416 degrees for 2013-14 academic year












The students who received the 30 doctorates, 102 master's degrees and 284 bachelor's degrees from ICS this year got an unforgettable sendoff as President Barack Obama addressed UC Irvine's 2014 Commencement at Angel Stadium of Anaheim on June 14. And let's not forget the most important part: The President of the United States of America now knows how to Zot! Click here for full coverage of the historic event.






Undergraduate/Master's Commencement


Bachelor’s and master's degree recipients were recognized at the on-campus Commencement for ICS and Engineering students on June 15. Kevin T. Lee, who received a B.S. in informatics, says he’ll treasure the memories he has made at ICS. As for what comes next, “I don't even know what to expect,” he says, “but I'm looking forward to it.” Click here for photos from the ICS/Engineering Commencement.







Doctoral Hooding Ceremony


Doctoral degree candidates, who attended their Graduate Hooding Ceremony on June 7, reminisce about their time as students and researchers at the Bren School. “I'll really miss the very energetic environment,” says Dennis Park, who earned his Ph.D. in computer science. “It's very good to learn; we just hope that we have a similar chance in industry.” Click here for photos of the Doctoral Hooding Ceremony.







Graduating Students Lunch












More than 50 undergraduates from the Bren School received an array of awards, ranging from Latin honors to recognition of outstanding research contributions. Dean Hal Stern recognized the awardees at the annual luncheon for graduating students, held on June 6 and hosted by the Student Affairs Office. Click here for the list of awardees.
