Welcome to the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences (Bren School of ICS), the only independent, computing-focused school in the University of California ten-campus system. 
Looking for a school with a comprehensive set of undergraduate computing and information technology degree programs?Want some flexibility in tailoring your plan of study to accommodate your area-specific or broad-ranging interests?Want the opportunity to design real-time solutions to real-world problems?Want to learn more about the research process by working on a faculty-led or independent project?Interested in building your career prospects early through internship and paid employment experiences?Do you have an interest or talent for entrepreneurial competition?
If you answered "yes" to any of these questions, you may be interested in learning more about the Bren ICS undergraduate majors:
Biomedical Computing (open to transfers, Fall 2011)Business Information ManagementComputer Game Science (open to transfers, Fall 2011)Computer ScienceComputer Science and EngineeringInformaticsInformation and Computer ScienceICS Undeclared Pre-Major (for freshmen applicants only)
View materials and video clips that provide an introduction to Bren ICS, the undergraduate majors, and some of our current students.
After your initial research, we invite you to schedule an appointment with an academic counselor by calling the ICS Student Affairs Office at (949) 824-5156 or emailing your contact information and possible campus visit dates to ucounsel@uci.edu. 
If given sufficient advance notice, the counselors may be able to also arrange for you to sit in on a class lecture, talk to current students, and meet with a professor or two.  You'll also be invited to Bren ICS "open house" events (usually scheduled from March – May), which feature faculty, counselors, current students and alumni sharing their thoughts about the the School’s strengths, curriculum, and learning and networking opportunities. 
A NOTE TO TRANSFER APPLICANTS:
      
      Bren ICS has created partnership agreements, called SMART-ICS, with several local community colleges. 
      
      These agreements specify community college courses, which, if completed successfully, provide student transfers subject credit for all lower division math and computer science coursework for certain Bren ICS majors. 
      
      To find out if a partnership agreement exists between the Bren School and your community college, visit the SMART-ICS page. 

IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING A SECOND BACCALAUREATE:
      
      Your application will be considered on a space-available basis.  Specifics about preparation and second baccalaureate admission criteria for the majors listed below are posted online.
      
Information and Computer ScienceComputer ScienceInformatics

Additional information for prospective students, parents, educators and counselors is available at UC Irvine’s Admissions and Relations with Schools, and the University of California’s web page.
UCI's priority application filing period is November 1-30; a successful review will result in an offer of admission for the subsequent fall quarter, which begins in late September. 
The sequential nature of some of the required courses for Bren School majors and the fact that some of these courses are offered only once per year make it beneficial for freshmen and transfer students to begin their studies in fall quarter. 
We thank you for taking the time to learn more about the opportunities awaiting you at the Bren School of ICS. 

IF YOU HAVE ALREADY SUBMITTED AN APPLICATION FOR ADMISSION:
    
Even though you are applying to a particular major or academic school at UCI, your application is handled centrally by UCI’s Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools. 
        
        Inquiries about the status of your application must be directed to the message center at your MyAdmissionsApplication page, or to UCI Admissions, (949) 824-6703. 
        
        Bren ICS counselors are not able to answer questions about the status of your admission application.
