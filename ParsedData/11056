Assignment 1

Please read the following short paper:

http://ddi.cs.uni-potsdam.de/HyFISCH/Produzieren/lis_projekt/proj_gamelife/ConwayScientificAmerican.htm

and implement John Conway’s Game
of Life.  You are encouraged (but not required) to use the following Java
source code, which has a grid world and a number of useful methods already
written for you.

†

If you use this file, please insert your code at ~line 112. 
It should not be necessary to add any code outside this method, although you
are welcome to alter and add to the rest of the code as you see fit.  Note: In
Eclipse, please set Run->Run…Parameters to Width = 500, Height = 540 for
best viewing.

†

Please comment all code that you add so that it is clear
what each section is doing.  

†

Please email wmt@uci.edu if you have any questions.

†

Please email the entire file to wmt@uci.edu by Monday,
1/19/04 at noon.

†

Note: If you’d like a bigger challenge (not required),
please adapt the code so that it uses the Von Neumann Neighborhood (see: http://mathworld.wolfram.com/vonNeumannNeighborhood.html

for more information) of range 1, 2 or 3 rather than the
Moore Neighborhood that it currently uses, and consider the impact of this
change on Conway’s genetic laws.
