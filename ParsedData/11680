					Annual Mentorship Program 2013

					
						Posted on 09/30/2013 by Angela Liu					

					
						This year’s Mentorship Program was a huge success! Monday, September 30th, a total of 67 mentees and mentors joined WICS and started the quarter off with the introduction of new WICS officers, future events and goals for this year.
Mentees got a chance to network with experienced upperclassmen, receive advice, and choose their mentor. WICS will be checking up with the paired mentors and mentees to make sure the connection will keep going for the rest of the year!
