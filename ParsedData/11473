Create a mailman.ics.uci.edu Mailing ListYou can create a new mailing list by entering the
    relevant information into the form below.  The name of the mailing list
    will be used as the primary address for posting messages to the list, so
    it should be lowercased.  You will not be able to change this once the
    list is created.

    You also need to enter the email address of the initial list owner.
    Once the list is created, the list owner will be given notification, along
    with the initial list password.  The list owner will then be able to
    modify the password and add or remove additional list owners.

    If you want Mailman to automatically generate the initial list admin
    password, click on `Yes' in the autogenerate field below, and leave the
    initial list password fields empty.

    You must have the proper authorization to create new mailing lists.
    Each site should have a list creator's password, which you can
    enter in the field at the bottom.  Note that the site administrator's
    password can also be used for authentication.
