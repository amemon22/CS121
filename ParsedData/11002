Where to Find Research Papers related to Text AnalysisCS 175, Winter 2015 

 The
conferences below typically occur once per year and often contain many
interesting applications of text analysis based on machine learning and
AI techniques - even if you can't understand the details of the papers,
the introductory sections and experiments may nonetheless provide
useful ideas for projects. Below are links to the 2014 conference
proceedings, but all of these conferences have proceedings published
for 2013, 2012, going back multiple years. Note that to access some of
the Proceedings below you may need to be on the UCI network. Also note
that for the AI and machine learning conferences that many of the
papers are about AI and ML in general, although there is typically a
subset with direct applications to text data. Conferences on Text and LanguageACM SIGIR (Information Retrieval): 2014 Conference, 2014 ProceedingsEmpirical Methods Natural Language Processing (EMNLP): 2014 Conference, 2014 ProceedingsAssociation for Computational Linguistics: 2014 Conference, 2014 ProceedingsConferences on Web and Social MediaWWW: 2014 Conference, 2014 ProceedingsACM Conference on Web Search and Data Mining (WSDM): 2014 Conference, 2014 ProceedingsInternational Conference on Web Logs and Social Media (ICWSM): 2014 Conference, 2014 ProceedingsConferences on AIAAAI: 2014 Conference, 2014 Proceedings IJCAI: 2013 Conference, 2013 Proceedings Conferences on Machine Learning and Data MiningInternational Conference on Machine Learning (ICML): 2014 Conference, 2014 ProceedingsNeural Information Processing Systems (NIPS): 2014 Conference, 2014 ProceedingsACM SIGKDD (Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining): 2014 Conference, 2014 Proceedings
