Graduate Student Policies: Graduate Student Review




At the end of each spring quarter, the ICS Graduate Student Affairs Office, in consultation with the department Vice Chairs and the Associate Dean, conducts a formal review of all 
graduate students enrolled in an ICS graduate program. The Bren School Graduate 
Office, Associate Dean for Student Affairs, and the student’s 
advisor review each student’s progress.
If unsatisfactory progress is being made, a letter of probation is sent to 
the student and placed in their file. The probation period varies, depending on 
the individual’s situation. If the problem is not cleared during the 
probation period, the Bren School Graduate Office may recommend to the UCI 
Graduate Division that the student be dismissed from the program. 
It is the student’s responsibility to make sure the Bren School Graduate 
Office is aware that a problem has been cleared during the probation period. 

Possible reasons for probation include: 
GPA below 3.0Too 
many “I” grades (Incompletes) or not finishing “I’s”Unsatisfactory 
progressNot affiliated with an advisorNot meeting degree milestones
