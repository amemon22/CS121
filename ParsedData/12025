ALL ICS Students • Mondays @ 7:00pm-8:00pm • ICS Room 432 • WHY: We all know the ICS Community is more divided than it should be! It’s hard to figure out what’s going on in ICS. So, to bring us all together and make sure that things like ICS Day and Reverse Career Fair are lasting, we’re changing this group!
Everyone is welcome to participate!
Our Mission
To improve student life of the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences academically, socially, and professionally by creating and deepening the bonds between students, faculty, administration, companies, and alumni of the ICS School as well as similar groups outside of the Information and Computer Sciences.
Our Vision
We believe that through a strong community, we will enhance the quality of student life and ensure great jobs for students of all majors and minors within the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Science by:
Understanding, disseminating, and contributing to departmental decisions including curriculum, research, and hiring decisionsCreating a network of alumni which will provide students with opportunities to grow while in school, and opportunities after graduation to leverage that growthProvide one another with tools and opportunities to become the most competitive technical experts in the worldDeveloping nontechnical skills such as leadership, team building, and advocacy outside of the classroom that will ultimately determine success in the rest of our careersInforming students about the immense opportunities that are available on the UC Irvine campus, in the neighboring community, and throughout the worldCreating partnerships between the academics of our campus and the related industries
