Lecturer Positions











Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences 
Department of Informatics
Full-Time Lecturer Position


The Department of Informatics at the University of California, Irvine is seeking
exceptional candidates for a full­?time lecturer position. The primary responsibility is
to teach up to seven (quarter) courses in our various degree programs,
undergraduate and graduate, with the primary focus on teaching human­?
computer interaction and design. The normal load is six courses, though that load
carries with it the expectation that additional time be devoted to curriculum
development, service to the department, and helping disseminate our work to the
broader educational community.


The initial appointment is for one year, though we expect the successful candidate to be
able to build a long­?term career in the department. We are particularly excited to
begin offering a new, partially online Master of Human Computer Interaction and
Design (MHCID) program aimed at working professionals in 2016­?2017, to which we
expect the lecturer to be able to contribute.


The department is strongly interdisciplinary, including faculty backgrounds in computer
science, information studies, game design, anthropology, organizational studies,
cognitive psychology, and media arts. This, in no small measure, contributes to our
excellent international reputation as an innovative site for research on and education in
all aspects of living, working, and building in a digital world. We wish to recruit a new
colleague who appreciates and feels comfortable in this atmosphere.


For three years in a row, UC Irvine has been ranked as the best U.S. university under
50 years old by Times Higher Education, and 5th internationally. Located in the heart of
diverse Orange County with a population of over 3 million, the campus enjoys the best
of what Southern California has to offer: beaches, mountains, deserts, and a broad
variety of cultural, entertainment, and intellectual activities.


Applicants should have a graduate degree (terminal degree, such as Ph.D. or MFA,
preferred) in a relevant field and exhibit a compelling teaching portfolio, as well as a
clear vision for teaching to a diverse audience.


Each application must contain: a cover letter, CV, a statement of teaching philosophy
and interests, a description of teaching experience with student evaluations if possible,
and the names and contact information of three relevant references. All materials must
be uploaded at:


https://recruit.ap.uci.edu/apply/JPF02754


The academic year begins in late September and ends mid­?June. The pay period
for a full­?time lecturer appointment is from July 1 through June 30 (a nine­?month
service period paid out over 12 months). Salary will be commensurate with degree and
experience.


Applications will be accepted until the position is filled, although maximum
consideration will be given to applications received by April 30, 2015.


The University of California, Irvine is an Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action
Employer advancing inclusive excellence. All qualified applicants will receive
consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national
origin, disability, age, protected veteran status, or other protected categories covered
by the UC nondiscrimination policy.
