				This manuscript has not been published; it proves bounds on the complexity of arrangements of m polytopes, with a total of n faces, at most c of which have a common intersection.  Some or all of the citations are for the close-to-trivial bound O(m^{ceil(d/2)} n^{floor(d/2)}).

We then apply these bounds in the analysis of algorithms for finding combinatorially distinct minimum spanning trees formed by adding one Steiner point to a point set.  See "On the number of minimal 1-Steiner trees" (same authors; DCG 1994) for closely related results on the number of possible such trees.
