Press release








 April 9,  2015UC Irvine and the National Center for Women & Information Technology to recognize 52 high school women for computing achievements 


Irvine, Calif. – As part of an effort to encourage more young women to 
choose careers in technology, the National Center for Women & Information Technology 
(NCWIT) and UC Irvine will recognize 52 high-school women for their accomplishments 
and aspirations in computing and technology. The award event will be held at UCI’s 
Donald Bren Hall 6011 at 3 p.m. on Saturday, April 11. 


The NCWIT Award for Aspirations in Computing is a program of the National Center for 
Women & Information Technology, a coalition of over 450 universities, corporations and 
organizations dedicated to increasing the meaningful participation of women in 
computing. The NCWIT Award for Aspirations in Computing was created to 
acknowledge the computing aspirations of young women, introduce them to leadership 
opportunities in the field, and generate visibility for women’s participation in computing-
related pursuits. Award-winners have been selected for their outstanding aptitude and 
interest in computing and desire to pursue computing-related studies of occupations. 


“With technology jobs projected to grow faster than all other job sectors in the next 
decade, it’s imperative that we nurture the computing aspirations of women, who will 
make up half the professional workforce,” said Lucy Sanders, CEO and co-founder of 
NCWIT.  “This award allows us recognize and encourage talent that might otherwise be 
overlooked.”


The Southern California affiliate of the NCWIT Award for Aspirations in Computing is a 
collaborative effort by dedicated volunteers led by Debra Richardson, professor of 
informatics and founding dean of the UCI’s Donald Bren School of Information and 
Computer Sciences.  “This is our fourth year recognizing Southern California’s young 
women with aspirations in Computing,” said Professor Richardson. “It’s so thrilling to 
meet these women, hear about their amazing accomplishments, and help to enable their 
future aspirations.”


Michelle Tjoa, a sophomore computer science major at the Donald Bren School who won Aspirations in Computing awards in 2013 and 2014, added, "Through NCWIT I learned about other opportunities and the great things that can be offered to girls in STEM.  I was also able to find my aspiration and learn how to cultivate my goals."
