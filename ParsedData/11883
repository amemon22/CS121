				Do you enjoy coming to the WICS meetings, but feel a little lonely? Do you want to get to know your fellow WICS members? Then come join us for a trip to the Aquarium of the Pacific! Bond with other WICS members while enjoying the aquarium’s many exhibits (there will be penguins!).
This event will happen on a Saturday in Long Beach, so keep that in mind and be sure to RSVP. If you can drive, be sure to mark that on the form. We look forward to seeing you there!
