					Movie Night and Boardgames with WICS

					
						Posted on 02/04/2014 by Angela Liu					

					
						
Monday, January 27th, WICS hosted a movie night for over 20 people that came to de-stress from all the midterms they’ve had/about to have! There was popcorn, pizza, and snacks provided while The Princess Bride was playing. A group of people were also enjoying a fun game of Monopoly! It was a nice relaxing night that helped keep people’s minds off of homework and exams; WICS will be having more social events like this in the future!
