Concentration in Informatics - Ubiquitous Computing Track (UBICOMP), (M.S.
 and Ph.D.)

Ubiquitous computing addresses the emergent trend of moving beyond 
the desktop   computer and embedding computation into the environment. 
With the proliferation   of palm devices, cell phones, digital cameras,
 smart sensors, and so on, some   of this paradigm shift has already 
happened. A lot more must happen to make   computers blend with the 
environment. 
CURRENT DEGREE REQUIREMENTS 
Ubiquitous computing addresses the emergent trend of moving beyond 
the desktop computer and embedding computation into the environment. 
With the proliferation of palm devices, cell phones, digital cameras,
smart sensors, and so on, some   of this paradigm shift has already 
happened. A lot more must happen to make computers blend with the 
environment.
Moving beyond the desktop into a model where computers are 
ubiquitous has important consequences in every aspect of computing 
systems development, from hardware and software design to HCI to   
social aspects of computing. And, as with any good paradigm shift, this
one doesn't invalidate the pre-existing models, concepts and tools: 
it expands them.
The field of ubiquitous computing, as such, is a vibrant research 
area. Specific research emphases of the UBICOMP faculty include   
programming models and tools for pervasive systems, experimental design
research involving sensor- rich systems, and empirical studies of 
ubiquitous computing technology.
