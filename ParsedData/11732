Hi everyone! My name is Delian Petrov, a rising Senior and your ICS Student Council President for the 2014-2015 year. I have big plans for the upcoming year and I am excited to better our existing events and create buzz-worthy new ones! How ICSSC generally works is that we like to start new events, get everyone excited for them, transition them to other club and organizations, and finally iterate back and create more new events. This way we can focus on truly innovating — all while having an open two way communication between students and faculty.
A little more about me, I grew up in Bulgaria and came to the United States when I was 8 years old. I lived in Chicago (couldn’t stand the cold) and after a year moved to sunny SoCal. I am pursuing a Bachelors in Informatics and a management minor. I was recently appointed to be the Google Student Ambassador for UCIrvine and will be working closely with Google to educate students about advances and opportunities. My ideal career plans is to travel — for leisure and business — and explore different cultures & ideas.
Zot! Zot!
