Examples of Applications and Demos for Text AnalysisCS 175, Winter 2015 

 The
links below are just a small example of the many Web pages you can find
discussing research demos, applications, sample code, for text analysis
using AI and machine learning techniques. These are intended to be a
starting point to help you in terms of thinking about ideas for
projects. Sentiment AnalysisStanford deep learning demo for sentiment analysis (Web page with code, data, papers)  Sentiment analysis of short informal texts (research paper)Example of using Python to build a Naive Bayes text classifier for sentiment analysis.
