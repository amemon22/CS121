 March 12,  2015SCSIM, UC Irvine partner to strengthen research and collaboration among  IT industry






 


IRVINE, Calif. — March 12, 2015 — The Southern California Chapter of the Society for 

Information Management (SCSIM) and the University of California, Irvine’s (UCI) Henry 

Samueli School of Engineering and Donald Bren School of Information & Computer Sciences 

School have announced a strategic partnership between the organizations.



The strategic partnership will strengthen collaborations between the state-of-the-art researchers 

at UCI and corporate leaders in IT and technology organizations. The organizations envision 

jointly sponsored activities as well as closer collaborations around performing and evaluating 

research, assessing industry trends and needs and facilitating talent acquisition. 



“Our faculty need input from companies regarding industry trends and needs. We anticipate this 

relationship will benefit both UCI and SCSIM members” said Dean Washington of the Henry 

Samueli School. Dean Stern of the Donald Bren School agrees: “our faculty, especially in areas 

like big data and cybersecurity, benefit from testing out our concepts on real data and live use 

cases. The partnership benefits both stakeholders.”



“We are tremendously excited to have UCI as a partner. UCI is known as world class creator 

and incubator of technology driven capabilities and of top talent. Forging this bond with UCI 

creates a mutually beneficial environment for companies and the schools. SCSIM member 

organizations stand to benefit from insight into leading edge research and capabilities and access 

to terrific students, while offering real world challenges for these UCI researchers to test their 

hypotheses against,” commented Brandon Johnson, SCSIM chairperson.
