January 22nd, last Tuesday, WICS hosted a Letter of Recommendation Workshop and Q&A with Professor Shannon Tauro and PhD candidate Kristin Roher!  Over 30 students attended for a pre-workshop social and a presentation on how to approach and establish relationships with professors for research, references, and letters of recommendation.
Thank you to Professor Shannon Tauro and Kristin Roher for their time and their (very) enlightening advice!
