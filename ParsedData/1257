Faculty Positions












University of California, Irvine  
Department of Informatics


Two Tenure-Track Faculty Positions



The Department of Informatics at the University of California, Irvine is seeking exceptional candidates for two tenure-track positions. The search is comprehensive, and we encourage applicants from a broad range of disciplines to apply. Our primary criterion is that the candidate’s work has to connect to and seek to advance the practice of software development – whether generally so or in a particular domain of interest. Software engineering, user interface design, ubiquitous computing, programming languages, and other such areas of research are within scope, and we appreciate work of all varieties, whether empirical, technological, methodological, or analytical in nature. 


The department is strongly interdisciplinary, including faculty backgrounds in computer science, game design, anthropology, organizational studies, cognitive psychology, and media arts. This, in no small measure, contributes to our excellent international reputation as an innovative site for research on and education in all aspects of living, working, and building in a digital world. We wish to recruit new colleagues who appreciate and feel comfortable in this atmosphere, and who will take leading roles in their own core disciplines but also build new bridges to stimulate innovate research.


For three years in a row, UC Irvine has been ranked as the best U.S. university under 50 years old by Times Higher Education, and 5th internationally. Located in the heart of diverse Orange County with a population of over 3 million, the campus enjoys the best of what Southern California has to offer: beaches, mountains, deserts, and a broad variety of cultural, entertainment, and intellectual activities. 


Applicants should have a Ph.D. in a relevant field and exhibit a compelling research portfolio as well as a clear vision for teaching to a diverse audience. Salary and other compensation, including priority access to on-campus faculty housing, are competitive with the nation’s finest public universities. 


Each application must contain: a cover letter, CV, up to three key publications, a statement of research and teaching interests, and 3-5 letters of recommendation. A separate statement that addresses past and/or potential contributions to diversity, equity, and inclusion should also be included. All materials must be uploaded at:


   https://recruit.ap.uci.edu/apply/JPF02649


Both positions are approved at the assistant professor level, though exceptional candidates at all ranks will be considered.


The position is for appointment in July 2015. Applications will be accepted until the position is filled, although maximum consideration will be given to applications received by January 15, 2015.
