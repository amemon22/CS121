Undergraduate Student Resources




ICS Student Organizations
ICS students are encouraged to participate in student organizations to complement their academics.  Below is a list of student organizations within the Donald Bren School of ICS.  
ICS Student Council
The ICS Student Councl is the official student government for the Donald Bren School of
Information and Computer Sciences. Their aim is to improve the lives of students
academically, professionally and socially.
iCAMP 
Interdisciplinary Computation and Applied Mathematics Program
iCAMP provides an opportunity for undergrads to learn about a topic in
computational applied mathematics. Opportunities are also available for paid
summer research.
WICS 
Women in Computer Sciences
By joining WICS, female students can surround themselves with their
peers and positive influences who, not only work with and can assist them with
their classes and curriculum, but can also help them network with other
successful women, giving them even more opportunities to succeed.
ACM 
Association for Computing Machinery, Student Chapter
The Association for Computing Machinery is the world's largest society
of information technology students and professionals. The chapter represents
the needs of the UCI computing community.
INSA 
Informatics Student Association
INSA works to unite the Informatics community at UCI and to promote the
Informatics major to students and companies alike. We offer workshops,
corporate visits and tours, individual tutoring and mentoring, tournaments and
competitions and networking/recruiting events with technology companies.
UCF 
Undergraduate Computing Federation
Promotes interaction between and provide resources to students with an
interest in Unix, Linux, FreeBSD, Network Security, Cryptography, or Ethical
Hacking. Open to all UCI undergraduate or graduate students.
IGDA 
International Game Developers Association, OC Chapter
MAISS 
Management Information Student Society
MAISS
is tailored to the interests of BIM majors at UC Irvine as well as those
interested in Business & Technology. On such a heavily-populated campus,
it's often difficult to find peers in the same major who go through the same
joys and struggles as you do. With Business Information Management (BIM) majors
few and far between, the need for a tight-knit community is even greater. At
MAISS, we bring together BIM majors to share the journey of personal growth and
professional development. You'll be able to connect with other BIM majors and
create lifelong friendships in the process. MAISS recognizes the challenges
that BIM students face and strives to expose BIM students to various resources
that will equip them for the real world post-graduation.
