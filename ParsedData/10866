CBCL Lab



Welcome to the lab for Computational Biology and Computational Learning at  School of Information and Computer Sciences of  University of California, Irvine!  




Our lab studies a broad range of problems in machine learning and computational biology/bioinformatics. We are interested in both developing machine learning methods and applying these methods to study problems from biology, especially in the areas of genomics and systems biology.
