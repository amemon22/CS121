        I am a 2nd year PhD student in the Computer Science Department at the University of California, Irvine.  Padhraic Smyth is my advisor, and I am a member of his DataLab research group.  My research interests reside in applying neural networks and other latent variable models to collaborative filtering and natural language processing tasks.
