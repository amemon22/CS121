CompSci 165: Project in Algorithms and Data Structures
     Spring 2014 


Description
    Design, implementation, execution, and analysis of algorithms
      Based on material from ICS 46 and CompSci 161, plus some more
          advanced topics
      The programming language will be C/C++ (each student's choice)
      There are 3 required projects,
          no homeworks and no examinations
      Prerequisites:
        CompSci 161 / CSE 161.   Recommended: ICS/CSE 45C
   
Class Meetings
    Lectures M W F 10-10:50am in DBH 1300
      Lectures discuss the theory behind the projects,
               as well as some implementation concerns
      The class meets only sporadically during the quarter,
          typically a couple of times for each of the projects
      One-on-one discussions with the instructor
               are available throughout the quarter

Add/drop Policy
   A student may add during the first two weeks if capacity allows and the student
        is able to find a willing partner for the first project, or
          is willing to do the first project solo
       
     A student may drop during the first two weeks if either the student
        is not registered with a teammate for Project 1, or
          is registered with a teammate Q for Project 1 and has made
              suitable arrangements so that Q is not stranded

             (Q also drops, Q is willing to "fly solo", or
               another pair is breaking up by mutual consent and
               one of them will partner with Q with mutual consent)

       
     No adds or drops are permitted after Week 2

 Compiler considerations for CompSci 165
 Some projects need to measure time usage
 Many projects need a random number generator; 
     I recommend using dshrandom.c
 Do you know the meanings of and distinction between precision and accuracy?


Access to project specifications is limited to enrolled students.

Communication — If you send me email with course-related questions...
     Include the string "CompSci 165:" at the start of the subject line
       Include your name and UCI Student ID number in the message
       If you are not writing from your official UCI email address,
           please cc your official UCI email address
    
    (This protocol enables me to weed out requests for help
            on problems from non-UCI students.)
