					Food and Fun with WICS

					
						Posted on 02/11/2014 by Angela Liu					

					
						On Monday, February 3rd, over 40 people came to de-stress at the potluck with all the ICS clubs over some delicious food and fun boardgames! There was a variety of food such as sushi, buffalo wild wings, dumplings, curry, chicken alfredo, bacon siracha cookies, and cake pops! Besides food, there were also groups of people playing Apples to Apples, Cards Against Humanity, and Uno! It was a fun and stress-free night full of some nice home-made food and all of your fellow ICS friends; we will be having more potlucks later in the school year, stay tuned if you want to come join the fun next time!
