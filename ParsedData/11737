			Hi everyone,
My name is Adrian Mandee, I am a fourth year BIM major, and I will be your new ICS Student Council Student Events chair for the 2014-2015 year.
What is Student Events? Student events does a variety of different things, from planning socials to preparing for ICS events. Our goal is to connect the student body of ICS with ICS Student Council and have fun doing it. Being in Student Events you’ll be able to help out in booths, talk with students, and spread the word of all our events, socials, and meetings.
