Graduate Student Policies: M.S. Thesis Option




Master’s Thesis Option

The thesis option is available to M.S. students who do not plan to take
the comprehensive exam and who are in good academic standing with the School
(note this option not available to students in the Statistics program).
Students pursuing this option must enroll in at least two quarters of Thesis
Supervision (CS 298 or Inf 298), which will substitute for two required courses
as specified under the concentration area or track of choice.
A
committee of three faculty members, the majority of whom must be from the
student’s department, will guide the student and give final approval of the
thesis. The committee consists of an advisor, who must be from the student’s
department and who is willing to supervise the thesis project, and two other
faculty members who are willing to serve on the committee as readers. An oral
presentation of the thesis to the committee is required.M.S. Thesis Option Policy
