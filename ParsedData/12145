Med AppJam is a two-week long tournament where students from all disciplines come together to form teams and create a fully functional and mobile medical application on the iOS Platform. Apps are judged on various criteria and the top teams are awarded prizes and recognition.
This year, the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Science will continue their partnership with the UC Irvine School of Medicine to put on this amazing event. We are also in the works of bringing in the Paul Merage School of Business to further incorporate entrepreneurship into Med AppJam.
